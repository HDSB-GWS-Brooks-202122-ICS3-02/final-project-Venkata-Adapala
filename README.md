# Whirlybird

## A Recreation of the Famous Google Game

The game has a black Android sprite that tries to jump as *high* as possible. In the process, it lands on *different platforms with different effects* (like breaking upon landing, killing the sprite, acting like a trampoline, etc.). The player needs to evade dangerous platforms and land on the favourable ones so that the sprite can continue to jump higher and score more.

The game starts with the Android sprite bouncing on various platforms that are all moving sideways. To choose which platform to land on, the user must use the **left/right arrow keys** or the **A/D keys**.

The **score**, which is based on the amount of time the sprite is alive, is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
